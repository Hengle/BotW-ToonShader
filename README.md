# Breath of the Wild - Toon shader
A recreation of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's toon shader in Unity, using Shader Graph and the Universal Rendering Pipeline.

The shader can be freely used for commercial purposes, no need for credit (though it would be nice).
Assets included are part of a Unity asset pack (see license for details).
